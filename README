RDF-Query-HTTPBindings

This module is intended to track the SPARQL 1.1 HTTP Bindings
specfication at 

  http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update/

For the time being, there are several unresolved issues, so this
module is created with the main purpose of being a discussion item for
the SPARQL Working Group (that I was a part of in an earlier job). 

The below isn't relevant yet, but it will once it is on CPAN.
